# The Caribbean Coffee Company ![](./.common/logo.png?raw=true)
by Joel Mussman<br/>
original project concept by Joel Mussman and Justin Poole 

The Caribbean Coffee Company is a cafe-operations project that I have developed as the basis for doing demonstrations
and class labs for almost every software development technology that I work with, from databases through devices.
The premise is that a customer can use a web site or a device app to browse the menu of the cafe, place an order,
and pay for it.
Cashiers and managers also reach the back-end through the web portal and point-of-sale terminals.
